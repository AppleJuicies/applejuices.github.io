                <li>Larry L. Howell is a mechanical engineer who's focus is in compliant mechanisms and origami. </li>
                    What is intresting about his work and research is the fundamental princinple behind what he does,
                    imitating nature. Nature usually doesnt develop complex multi-parted verisons of their bodily components, for example, plants.
                    they're made out of one piece and have integrated functions within its one part. I started reading his book and realized that I should give it
                    a try due to the practice being quiet innovative and also beneficial to product development, less parts the better.

                <li>Patterns can be difficult when modeling on cad. Developing and dimensioning correctly is massively important.
                    Splicing and projecting a random design onto a curved surface is not always as easy as one may thing. In which case
                    to make a soccer ball we have to make tiles with desired patterns which fit within a certain size, from there we can use
                    the stitch and pattern tool to make the ball with the shapes we want.

            <ul>
                <li> In my opinion, one of the most underated tools has to be a clamp. It acts like an extra pair of hands which is extremely useful
                    a lot of the time. In which case, I made a clamp, I thought about the importance of surface adaptability and realized my tolerance
                    knowledge, with that I was able to develop a 3D printed ball joint that allows that action. The clamp works like I inteded and I used it
                    to hand stich the photo albumn I made for my girlfriend.

                <li> I'm nearly sure youve seen this design somewhere on instagram if your feed looks anything like mine. In which case, heres another one!
                    I really like this design and the idea makes even more sense with some understanding of dynamic pressure from when I took fluid mechanics.
                    Like I said I really like the idea but as always, thought to my self "how could I make this better?" and so I added the ability for the flow
                    be directional by inplementing dividors in the upper region of the design. I did also account for the adhesion factor (what happens when you 
                    extend your arm in the shower) and that because of that regularly the water would pool towards the middle regardless. Thats why I made sure
                    that the middle portion of the bottom part of the desing had a concave shape so that that water doesn't pull to the middle when being directional.

            <ul>
                <li>while a fluid is moving though a pipe a method of making this fluid flow faster is by making the pipe 
                    taper and reduce crosssectional area so that pressure decreases. Intesting enough, though, doing some research
                    I was able to find a design of a centrifugal compressor which intrests me due to inate intricate method of accelerating flow
                    See what happens is that this thing called a centrifugal impeller spins really quick and increases the kinetic and potential energy of the air 
                    I thought to my self "well what if I didnt want the propellor to move?" and so I make fins inside of a tube. These fins passively rotate the 
                    air as it passes through the tube and increase the outlet velocity. They also do this because they constrict the area of the tube (and centrifugal impellers actually increase it)
                    but never the less, playing around with the principle is entertaining. Centrifugal forces!

            <ul>
                <li> Situation: You are flushing a toilet every 15 minutes thats filled with boiling hot liquid (tea?).
                    Lets say the tubing isn't neccesarily the best material so a solution is increasing surface area and naturally circular rod shaped fins area 
                    a great method of doing this as i've learned in heat transfer. So we add some fins to the tubing. The issue now is that the 
                    flow is too frequent, and the fins don't have time to cool down fast enough. Instead of adding an extra set of fins, heres an idea, lets make half 
                    the fins have a hollow gradient where at the bottom of the fin its relatively open and hollow and towards the top the object is fully solid. (a rod with a 
                    cone shaped drilled out of it.). I went on to solidworks and simulated this, and it kind of worked the way I imagined it.

                <li> This was an assignment that my class gave me, I dreaded this assignment at the time because of how tedious. It revolved around 
                    Making a beam have no more than .2mm of deflection after the load is applied. Afer many attempts and little progess, I found questioning
                    this assignment and asking why the force isnt moved, why isnt the structure and the environment changed, why isnt the supportive feature changed,
                     Can we add ballons to hold it up? I thought questioning my environment is probably the easiest way to solve this problem and in real life a solution
                    that removes the problem from its entirety would probably be the best solution.

            <ul>
                <li> I am in charge of developing the muffler for my FSAE team, and there are a lot of designs that are viable but idealy we have something
                    efficient and easy to manufacture. A large step and important piece of building the muffer is the size of the chamber that make up the destructive interference.
                    In order to have an idea of where we want the chambers to sit, an idea I had was simulating air flow through the muffler and seeing which configurating reduces and restricts 
                    air flow the best. The aim here, assuming all parameters are constant (air pressure, velocity, etc.) was to see changes in the air flow. The more restrictive, the more the sound waves
                    have to bounce around. Though this is OBVIOUSLY not the best way to simulate sound due to sound properties being ultimately different. The idea and execution was there and did help us get an idea
                    and comparative during the fabrication of the new muffler.

            <ul>
                <li> I LOVE the look of aero wheels, best examples are shown through rally cars or more recently, Tesla. I happen to own a Tesla
                    and I thought it would be a cool project to develop and print aero wheels for my tesla. This is a little harder than you would
                    think because of poor documentation that there is around to find sizes and what not. The design I went with consists of the following:
                    A threaded piece that attaches to the center lug of the wheel. This piece is vital due to to being the main portion that will hold everything
                    This piece also has a stem that sticks out from the center that is also threaded, this will be vital for locking everything together. My next 
                    piece is kind of like a washer and the piece after that is what holds the "fins" of the wheels, the washer helps it not lossen or fly off somehow.
                    this is all squished together by a cap that pushes everything tightly into place. A very fun GD&T, DFM, DFA project.

                    "youre either coming with me or we're done". If that doesnt describe my families mentality 
                    I dont know what does. What im trying to get at is that if something is going to get done
                    theres no time to waste, I only know two efforts, none or all. If my mind is set on something,

                <li>Personally, I think i'm delusionally optimistic and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I
                    don't think it works against me like some people may think. It's important to be positive in
                    my opinion. Though I would agree that it is also important to not get your hopes up to often.
                    My positive mentality ties into my ambitions and my ultimate motivation, if you think good 
                    energy and enact positive actions towards your goal, you will more than likely achieve it
                    simple as that! A lot of frustration can be avoided by thinking positively, thinking negatively
                    actaully wastes time, why try something if you know youll fail, I say, even if I fail, I told
                    my self that there could be a chance I actually do something incredibly difficult, then, im either incredibly impressed
                    by my actions, or not frustrated because I realized that I set quiet an ambitions goal which reasonably
                    I couldn't achieve. All or none baby!</li>
