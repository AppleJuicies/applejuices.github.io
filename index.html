Get Cozy! I must implore that if you are a recruiter, WELCOME! super happy to have you, this bauhaus inspired concept of a website was meant to hold a bunch of my professional experience and personality. I really hope you enjoy it and have fun exploring this website that I put together and learning about me! I apologize in advance if you don't enjoy every aspect of it. To make you feel better about that, refresh the page and watch the colours change, hopefully that distracts you from a bug you may encounter.</a> -->

                <li>Larry L. Howell is a mechanical engineer who's focus is in compliant mechanisms and origami. </li>
                    What is intresting about his work and research is the fundamental princinple behind what he does,
                    imitating nature. Nature usually doesnt develop complex multi-parted verisons of their bodily components, for example, plants.
                    they're made out of one piece and have integrated functions within its one part. I started reading his book and realized that I should give it
                    a try due to the practice being quiet innovative and also beneficial to product development, less parts the better.
                <li>Iterated a bag chip clip made out of one piece of PLA. </li>
                <li>Adjusted thicknesses and manipulated compliant portion of design to an optimial width and curvature.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>My parents are immigrants, theres a lot to unpack there if im going to be honest.
                    what you should know is that my father came to the united states with nothing, 
                    submerged waist deep in water for about 3 days as he crossed a 90 mile stretch of nothing 
                    to figure his life out somewhere he was free to do. my ma then made a similar 
                    sacrifice leaving everything she had when my dad went back to Cuba, just go to get her,
                    "youre either coming with me or we're done". If that doesnt describe my families mentality 
                    I dont know what does. What im trying to get at is that if something is going to get done
                    theres no time to waste, I only know two efforts, none or all. If my mind is set on something, 
                    even if I dont know how to get there, ill figure.

            <ul>
                <li>Personally, I think i'm delusionally optimistic and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I
                    don't think it works against me like some people may think. It's important to be positive in
                    my opinion. Though I would agree that it is also important to not get your hopes up to often.
                    My positive mentality ties into my ambitions and my ultimate motivation, if you think good 
                    energy and enact positive actions towards your goal, you will more than likely achieve it
                    simple as that! A lot of frustration can be avoided by thinking positively, thinking negatively
                    actaully wastes time, why try something if you know youll fail, I say, even if I fail, I told
                    my self that there could be a chance I actually do something incredibly difficult, then, im either incredibly impressed
                    by my actions, or not frustrated because I realized that I set quiet an ambitions goal which reasonably
                    I couldn't achieve. All or none baby!</li>
